    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards
        as &quot;merry&quot;, they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends
        on the individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with
        strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their
        tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In
        a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the Beagle was given the highest excitability
        rating, along with the Yorkshire Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland
        White Terrier, and Fox Terrier.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beagles are intelligent but, as a result of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and
            determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have
            picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally
            feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are
            eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren&#39;s
            The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of
            working/obedience intelligence. Coren&#39;s scale, however, does not assess understanding,
            independence, or creativity. </p>
